## Common Questions

### Q: How accurate are the forecasts?
**A:** Accuracy depends on your data quality and patterns. Typically:
- Simple trends: 80-90% accuracy
- Seasonal data: 70-85% accuracy
- Irregular patterns: 60-75% accuracy

The R² score in results shows model fit (closer to 1.0 = better).

### Q: Can I forecast multiple products at once?
**A:** Yes! Upload data with multiple products, then either:
- Forecast all products together (total sales)
- Use filters to forecast specific products

### Q: What if I don't have much historical data?
**A:** You can still generate forecasts with as little as 30 data points, but:
- Results will be less reliable
- Use simpler models (Linear Regression)
- Interpret with caution
- Gather more data over time

### Q: How do I know which model to use?
**A:** Start with Prophet (good for most cases), then:
- Compare all models using the comparison feature
- Check R² scores (higher = better fit)
- Look at the forecast charts (which looks more reasonable?)
- Ask AI which model it recommends

### Q: Can I save my forecasts?
**A:** Yes! Download as CSV and save on your computer. The app also:
- Keeps your uploads in your account
- Maintains forecast history (coming soon)

### Q: What's the difference between confidence levels?
**A:** Confidence levels show forecast uncertainty:
- **80%:** Narrower range, 20% chance actuals fall outside
- **95%:** Standard choice, 5% chance actuals fall outside
- **99%:** Widest range, 1% chance actuals fall outside

Use 95% for most business decisions.
